## Install

```
$ npm install @engineerapart/next-workbox-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

```js
const nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('@engineerapart/next-workbox-webpack-plugin');

nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin({
	// Should debug mode be forced? If true, this will set workbox.setConfig({ debug: true }); in the service worker
	debug: false,
  // must, you can get it at time time of Next.js compiling
  buildId: '6c071eb6-ab01-47bc-8074-71057afc1f64',
  // optional, next.js dist path as compiling. most of cases you don't need to fix it.
  distDir: '.next',
  // optional, which version of workbox will be used in between 'local' or 'cdn'. 'local'
  // option will help you use copy of workbox libs in localhost.
  importWorkboxFrom: 'local',
	// optional ,whether make a precache manifest of pages and chunks of Next.js app or not.
	// if true, your next build will be used to generate the paths.
	// if an array of strings, the next build will be used in addition to the paths you specify.
	// This allows you to add arbitrary URLs to the precache manifest URL list.
  precacheManifest: true | string[],
  // optional, whether delete workbox path generated by the plugin.
	removeDir: true,
	// Where the service worker will be copied to, as well as the workbox bundle, if using importWorkboxFrom = 'local'
	swDestRoot: './static/workbox',
	// The root of the SW url you want generated for the service worker and its scripts. It is recommended to leave this
	// as the default value if you are using importWorkboxFrom = 'local'. If you use 'cdn', this value only determines
	// the folder where `sw.js` is copied to.
	swURLRoot: '/static/workbox',
	// This URL is pre-pended to the precached URLs generated by the plugin, e.g.
	// if cdnRoot = 'https://yourpage.com', then the URLs generated look like:
	// https://yourpage.com/_next/7b3a3428-687c-43cb-a835-164b6550c593/page/index.js
	cdnRoot: '',
	// optional, you can use workbox-build options. swDest will be forced to use the basename, e.g. if you provide
	// /some/path/sw.js only `sw.js` will be used, and placed in swDestRoot.
	// All workbox-build config options that are not specified above will be passed through to workbox-build.
	// For all available options, please see
	// https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build#generateswstring_mode
  ...WorkboxBuildOptions,
});
```

## Usage in next.config.js

```
const NextWorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('@engineerapart/next-workbox-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, {isServer, dev, buildId, config: {distDir}}) => {
    if (!isServer && !dev) {
      config.plugins.push(new NextWorkboxWebpackPlugin({
        distDir,
        buildId,
				swDestRoot: './static', // copy sw.js to your static folder
				swURLRoot: '/static'
      }))
    }

    return config
  }
}
```

## How it works

For Next.js, It contains some of restrictions:

- Only works in `not dev mode` and on `the custom server` which means you can't test with `next` and `next start`
- You need customized server for serving service worker scripts and workbox libraries. For your convenience, [test server is in this package](https://github.com/engineerapart/next-workbox-webpack-plugin/blob/master/bin/next-workbox-start.js).
- All of files will be generated in `static/workbox` because of exporting. You might need to add the path to gitignore.
```

```
- You have to [add register service worker script](https://github.com/engineerapart/next-workbox-webpack-plugin/blob/master/examples/hello-pwa/pages/index.js) into part of your application
